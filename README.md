<br>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>There are so many people who I would talk to about sales and marketnig at different meetups and groups that didn't quite understand the differnce between the two. Many people had a good idea of one or the other but didn't really understand a way to check their knowledge or understand how they overlap. I created this as a way for those who might not be 100% familiar with the sales and marketing side of the business they work for to better understand what the sales and marketing teams do.</p>

<h2>Tech used</h2>
